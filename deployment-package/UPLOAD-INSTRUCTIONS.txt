   → Check file permissions (644)

❌ CSS not working (no styling):
   → Check _next/static/css/ folder uploaded
   → Clear browser cache completely
   → Check browser console (F12) for errors

❌ JavaScript not working:
   → Check _next/static/chunks/ folder uploaded
   → Clear browser cache
   → Check browser console for errors

❌ Images not showing:
   → Check all image files uploaded to root
   → Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   → Check file permissions (644)

❌ Navigation not working:
   → Check .htaccess is uploaded
   → Check all page folders uploaded
   → Check folder permissions (755)

❌ Golden hover effects not working:
   → This is CSS-only, should work automatically
   → Clear browser cache
   → Try different browser
   → Check if CSS files loaded (F12 → Network tab)

📊 FILE CHECKLIST:
==================

Before you finish, verify these are uploaded:

Core Files:
□ .htaccess

💡 PRO TIPS:
============

1. Upload _next folder as a ZIP:
   - Zip the _next folder on your computer
   - Upload the ZIP to Hostinger
   - Extract it in File Manager
   - This is faster than uploading files one by one

2. Use FTP for faster upload:
   - Get FTP credentials from Hostinger
   - Use FileZilla or WinSCP
   - Upload entire deployment-package folder
   - Much faster than web File Manager

3. Check browser console:
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any red errors
   - This helps identify issues quickly
