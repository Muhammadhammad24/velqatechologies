## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Vercel

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (Easiest)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Muhammadhammad24/velqatechologies)

### Option 2: Manual Deploy

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Vercel"
git push origin main
```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository: `Muhammadhammad24/velqatechologies`
   - Click "Deploy"

That's it! Vercel will automatically:
- Detect Next.js
- Install dependencies
- Build the project
- Deploy to production
